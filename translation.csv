CRAWL_OPEN,"Since my childhood on Cape Cod, the ocean has always commanded my fearful respect. It’s capability for calm and for violence, seemingly at a moment's notice, inspired a dreadful allure that carried through my life, eventually landing me in service aboard a submarine for the Allied forces. It’s this life long fascination that I reflect on now as our battered submarine sinks into the depths of the Atlantic. Everyone aboard waited with bated breath as our battered sub sunk lower into darkening waters, waiting for that final groan from the metal before we would be crushed, but it never came.

After sinking for what felt like a week the sub ran aground, but we found ourselves somewhere out of space and time far from the frigid waters of the Atlantic. As we departed the sub, we found ourselves standing before the gate of a city that looked as if it came from a piece of Arthurian lore. A deep, bone-rattling groan sounded from within, bringing us to our knees and casting a black veil over my vision. When I awoke, the rest of the crew was gone and I was left with a name burned into my mind: Regnum Voproth."
CRAWL_CLOSE,"Before me lay a piece of Voproth’s essence, pulsing and convulsing as it struggled against a death it never imagined would come. Through the door behind me, I could hear a terrible guttural shrieking. The beasts were wreaking havoc across the dream, and soon Voproth’s mind, and everyone within it, would fade into a void. Knowing my chances of survival had long since expired, I reached out to the essence. If I could not leave Voproth’s mind, I had to know what it was, but as my hand slipped into the essence I was jerked through. I felt my mind tear open as though something was parsing through the folds of my brain like a bookshelf. My grip on reality began to tear at the seams and I let out a scream for whatever horror was doing this to stop. As I did, I was spat out into an endless desert of pristine white. I called out, but no sound left my lips. I saw something in the corner of my eye and turned to meet it, but there was nothing there. I began to run, fearful of what might be lurking, but nothing ever showed itself, save for that shape which I would occasionally see in my peripheral.

I’ve been walking through the white desert for weeks, unable to sleep. Whatever stalks me has begun to stay longer within my vision. I call out to it, but it offers no response. Whatever it is, I hope it takes me soon."

NOTE_SHAW_1,"April 16, 1889: Never in all my voyages across the oceans of the world have I seen the weather turn so quickly. Blue skies and not a cloud in sight vanished in a moment. The gales were fierce and brought the Eliza down before we had a chance to say our prayers. Only three of the crew arrived in this hell. Perhaps they were the lucky ones. We can hear voices from within the city, perhaps others have been stranded here. - Shaw"
NOTE_SHAW_2,"April, 1889: Time is impossible to tell where there is no day or night. We entered the city only to find it empty, but the voices of the crew are always calling to us from just out of sight. The boy seems to be losing his nerve, poor lad, he says he can hear his father and wants to set out to find him. Smitty and Arthur haven’t spoken in at least a day, they just keep staring up at the tower. - Shaw"
NOTE_SHAW_3,"Arthur disappeared as we slept. He’d been going on about wanting to join “them.” I suspect they might be the eyes that I feel constantly watching me. Smitty has been reduced to a blubbering mess, and the boy keeps leaving and returning. He begs me to come see what he found, but I won’t leave the foot of the tower. I do not know how I may escape, but I won’t follow these loons to my death. Something within the tower calls to me in my dreams, and I do not know why, but I must reach it.
 - Shaw"
NOTE_SHAW_4,"The boy ran off into the manor, screaming that he had to understand. I dare not try and describe the sounds I heard from within, but something lurks within and has been waiting for us to come to it. I must find the keys and get out. - Shaw"
NOTE_SHAW_5,"As I unlocked the tower, some of those things from the manor came and dragged Smitty off screaming. He no longer sounded like the man I knew, but a wounded animal. All that is left for me is to ascend and find out what this has all been for. May God help me. - Shaw"
NOTE_MISC_1,"Our lord is dying and his wonderful dream is collapsing. The others call me a heretic, but I shall ascend the tower and meet his essence. A red key wrapped in the corrupting flesh and a key of blue guarded by the faithful will grant passage."
NOTE_MISC_2,"The more I scratch, the more it spreads. Why did God damn me to this accursed place? Those monsters have stopped chasing me, now they only watch as their corruption takes me. I must find the way out."
NOTE_MISC_3,"Voproth, hear your humble servant. Grant me the blessing of your form. May I be worthy to live within your mind as a guide for all who would enter your sacred dream."
